    "description": "I've always liked the idea that my camera and I capture the beauty which already is out there; it exists, but not everyone notices it. I get excited everytime I take a great photo. I enjoy taking pictures of people, weddings, engagements,  but especially portraits and travel photography since I travel a lot. What I like about my job is the fact that I meet and work with many interesting people who inspire me and who are the reason I like my job so much. I've been taking pictures for a long time and everytime I learn something new. It would be an honour for me if you chose me to be your photographer."
